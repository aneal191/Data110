## Rock climbing skills

#### Knots & Ropes
- **The figure eight** (*It looks like a number 8*): This is the most important knot to learn
- **The bowline** This knot is used less frequently
- 
#### Belaying
- **Using a grigri** (*a safe option*): This is the device commonly used in gyms
- **Using an ATC** (*requires more attention by the belayer*) Many old-school climbers like this and minimalists

#### Climbing
